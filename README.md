# Surf's Up: Using Weather Analysis To Determine Investments in a Possible Surf Cafe on O‘ahu

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this project is to analyze weather conditions on the island of O‘ahu in order to determine if it's worth investing in a surf cafe.

## Results: 
1) **Consistently nice temperatures**: Temperatures on O‘ahu are consistently within 70-80 degrees Fahernheit year round. Below is a cumulative graph between 2010-2017:

2) **Temperature Over Time**: More specifically, June temperatures are slightly higher than December temperatures.

## Summary: 
- In short, the island of Oahu is a great place to set up a surf cafe. The weather is consistently nice (in the 70s-80s) year round, and it also has a low amount of rain (between 0.10 and 0.22 inches per month). 
- Some future areas of analysis to put together could be:
  - Calculating the total average precipitation by station over the course of the year. 
  - Calculating the average temperature by station over the course of the year. 
- Both of these views will allow us to assess the accuracy of each station (since all of them are dispersed at different locations and elevations). Knowing this information, we can then compare the weather data to the proposed location of the cafe.
